### Description

A Feather board without ambition is a Feather board without FeatherWings! Spice up your Feather project with a beautiful 2.4" touchscreen display shield with built in microSD card socket. This TFT display is 2.4" diagonal with a bright 4 white-LED backlight. You get  240x320 pixels with individual 16-bit color pixel control. It has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display. As a bonus, this display comes with a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen.

This FeatherWing uses a SPI display so it works fast on each and every one of our Feathers. We also include an SPI resistive touchscreen controller so you only need one additional pin to add a high quality touchscreen controller. One more pin is used for an optional SD card that can be used for storing images for display.

This Wing comes fully assembled with dual sockets for your Feather to plug into. You get two sockets per pin so you can plug in wires if you want to connect to Feather pins. Alternatively, each pin has a large square pad on the PCB for direct soldering.

Four mounting holes make it easy to attach this Wing anywhere. We also include a big reset button and an on/off switch connected to the Feather Enable pin (note that the Teensy 3.x Feather does not use the Enable pin so the switch will not do anything with that type).
